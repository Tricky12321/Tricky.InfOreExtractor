# Tricky.InfOreExtractor

Mad Vandal 6/10/2018 
1) Updating from current FCE P20 Ore Extractor code.
2) Won't upload from FCE for some reason...appears to be due
to some odd mojo with the preview image. Mod had to be uploaded through SteamCMD using the included .vdf file with preview
image parameter ommitted.

Mad Vandal 6/10/2018 Update #2 
1) Restored the ARTHER notification feature with will hopefully work simulateously with the vanilla ore extractor.
2) Removing the preview image allows for uploading from inside FCE to work again. Fortunately ommitting the preview image leaves the current one in place so I'm not going to mess with that any further. The Visual Studio post build event will copy all the files to the mod folder Windows automatically on compile so you can test and upload inside FCE with no manual file copying.
